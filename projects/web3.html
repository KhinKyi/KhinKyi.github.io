                <h1>Merry Meal Site</h1>
                <p>This is MerryMeal site and the site helps needy grown-ups at home with daily hot meals. 
                    They offer service Monday to Friday, delivering frozen meals 
                    to those far away and support on weekends within 10km.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the Merry Meal website, we utilize Spring Boot and React. 
                    This project is a group project with 5 team members and I am responsible for 
                    coding the frontend registration and donation forms. 
                    I also helped with the wireframe design and storyboard of it too.</p>
